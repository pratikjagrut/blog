## Array

The array is a collection of the same type of element in a contiguous memory location.
The array has fixed length i.e the number of elements to be stored is fixed before memory allocation.

In Go, the type `[n]T` is an array of length `n` and type `T`.

### Array Declarations 

```
// i is an array of length 3, 
// it means it can hold upto 3 int values
var i [3]int
i[0] = 1
i[1] = 10
i[2] = 100
```

**Short-hand declaration**
```
j := [3]string{"Go", "is", "fun"}
```

## Slices

Slices are a pivotal data type in Go, giving a more powerful interface to sequences than arrays. 
An array has a fixed size whereas the slice is a dynamically-sized.

The type `[]T` is a slice with elements of type `T`.

### Slice formation

#### Creating a slice with make

Slices can be created with the built-in make function; this is how you create dynamically-sized arrays. `make([]T, len, cap(optional))`

```
a := make([]int, 5)    // len(a) = 5
b := make([]int, 0, 5) // len(b) = 0, cap(b) = 5
```

#### Creating a slice from array

Slice can be formed by specifying 2 indices, high bound and low bound, `s[low : high]`. 
This selects a half-open range which includes the first element but excludes the last one.
 
```
odds := [5]int{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}

var o []int = odds[1:4]
```

We can skip low or high bound to use their defaults. For low bound default is `0` and for high bound default is `length of an array`.

`a[:high]`, `a[low:]` 

### Slice are like references to arrays

A slice does not store any data, it just describes a section of an underlying array.

Changing element of the slice will make those changes to an underlying array and all other slices which share the same underlying array.

```
alphabet := [5]string{"A", "B", "C", "D"}

i := alphabet[0:3]
j := alphabet[1:4]

i[2] = "P" // This changes will affect alphabet, i ,j slices
```

### Slice literals

A slice literal is like an array literal without the length.

```
i := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5,}
```

### Length and capacity

The length of a slice is the number of elements it contains.

The capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying array, counting from the first element in the slice.

Length: `len(s)`

Capacity: `cap(s)`

### Appending

Slices support several operations including basic operations of arrays. One of such operation is appending.

```
z := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
z = append(z, 6, 7, 8) //1st arg is slice, and then can take any number of arg to append
```
